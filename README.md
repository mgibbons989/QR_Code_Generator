# **QR Code Generator**

Here I created a QR Code generator using the [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/) and [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) libraries!

For one, I created a QR code that leads to [my Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/_.mxddi/)! (Go give me a follow! ;))

The other one is based on user input for the parameters of the QR Code!
